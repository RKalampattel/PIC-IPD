# PIC-IPD

*A particle-in-cell code for modelling inductive plasma discharge.*

PIC-IPD is a 2D axisymmetric particle-in-cell (PIC) code designed to run on Windows. It makes use of the Monte Carlo collisions (MCC) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods to model inductive plasma discharge in a self-consistent manner. The code has been developed in Visual Studio using the Intel C++ compiler. External dependencies include the [OP2A](https://github.com/minkwankim) and [FFTW](https://github.com/FFTW) libraries. Post-processing of data is completed using the program Tecplot.
